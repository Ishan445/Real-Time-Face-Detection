# Real-Time-Face-Detection
Real-time face detection using OpenCV's DNN module.
This project implements a real-time face detection system using OpenCV's DNN module with a webcam stream.  
It leverages a pre-trained Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) with a ResNet-10 backbone, provided by the OpenCV team.
The code is structured for readability and has been modified and extended beyond the original tutorial for clarity and personal learning.

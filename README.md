# Real-Time Face Detection with OpenCV DNN

This project implements a real-time face detection system using OpenCV's DNN module with a webcam stream.  
It leverages a pre-trained Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) with a ResNet-10 backbone, provided by the OpenCV team.   
The code is structured for readability and has been modified and extended beyond the original tutorial for clarity and personal learning.

## Features

- Real-time face detection from webcam feed
- SSD-based deep learning face detector using OpenCV DNN
- Confidence score and inference time overlay
- Frame flipping for natural camera preview
- Self-contained model loading and input checks

## Model Information

The face detection model is a lightweight SSD with ResNet-10, trained using the Caffe framework.
It is designed for real-time performance and included in the OpenCV model zoo.
